Citations were added in many cases to correctly tie the narrative to sources. I was doing this to improve the chance of a B article or better. The missing citations were noted in templates that were several years old indicating a lack of interest by anyone else to make the corrections. Changes to each section (other than a few typos in various places)</p>
